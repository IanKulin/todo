# todo

This is a 'To Do' web app built on Node.js/Express. It allows the user to add items, and to mark them as done (which deletes them). The data is persisted between server restarts.

This basic version uses:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- SQLite

Different versions are saved in the GitHub repo as [branches](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/enfuturama/images/5/5b/Santa.png/revision/latest?cb=20100527184531) where I've tried out other technologies.
