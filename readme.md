# todo

This is a 'To Do' web app built on Node.js/Express. It allows the user to add items, and to mark them as done (which deletes them). The data is persisted between server restarts.

This htmx version uses:
- HTMX
- CSS
- SQLite

I wanted to get my head around the HTMX processes, and to have a comparison with a Javascript version to think about the pros and cons. 

If you are interested in using HTMX seriously (and I think anyone working in non-JS backends probably should be considering it), it's worth reading [the book](https://hypermedia.systems/hypermedia-components/).


Different versions of the todo app are saved in the GitHub repo as [branches](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/enfuturama/images/5/5b/Santa.png/revision/latest?cb=20100527184531) where I've tried out other technologies.
