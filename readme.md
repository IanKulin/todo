# todo

This is a 'To Do' web app built on Node.js/Express. It allows the user to add items, and to mark them as done (which deletes them). The data is persisted between server restarts.

This React version uses:
- Vite
- React
- SQLite

Different versions are saved in the GitHub repo as [branches](https://github.com/IanKulin/todo/branches) where I've tried out other technologies.

To build `npm run build`
To run the server `node server.cjs`
